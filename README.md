### About

#### AI Details

Linkuistix is a word association game that is built with the [Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4) model, available from the [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub). The USE encodes text into 512-dimensional embeddings, which can be used to determine [semantic similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity).

The USE was trained on different textual inputs from the internet and, beyond comparing individual strings, can also predict words or phrases that might come next in a conversation. Further technical information on this model can be found in the original _Google Research_ paper by [Cer _et al_. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11175).

**In this game, players are presented a target word and are required to submit an associated word to score points. For example, if the target word is _cat_, the player may enter _kitten_.**

We are proud and excited to present Linkuistix to you. Enjoy!

### Installation

If you would like to download and run the source code for this game onto your own machine, you will need to configure your [local firebase environment](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env) and set up a _.env file_ as appropriate. If you have done this, please follow the list of commands outlined below:

1. Cloning this repository

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:DrTeethCapstone/Linkuistix.git
   ```

2. Installing NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Starting the server

   ```js
   npm run start
   ```

4. Opening the game locally

   ```sh
    http://localhost:3000/
   ```

### Playing the game

<!-- TODO ADD SCREENSHOTS AND DETAILS OF ACCEPTED USER INPUTS -->

The AI allows Linkuistix to present a set of words to the player and then rank how closely each of the presented words is associated with the player's input. If the player inputs a word that is closely associated with the targeted word the player gets points added to their score and a new set of words is presented. The time the player has to input words decreases the more they play until eventually the player is unable to enter a closely associated word in time.

To get started, simply navigate to [linkuistix.com](https://www.linkuistix.com) or https://capstone-dev-940e9.web.app/, select an option to play as a guest (or sign up) and follow along with the in-game tutorial.
